# CICD

- CI = Continuous Integration
    - when new code is pushed, tests run automatically
    - if something breaks, the the pipeline is stopped until the issue it resolved
- CD = Continuous Deployment
    - when the code passes all tests, the code is shipped automatically to staging or production
- Our job as a DevOps Engg is to code these pipelines, using tools like:
    - GitHub Actions
    - GitLab CI
    - Jenkins
    - Circle CI
- We need to define each step from build, test, release and deploy.
