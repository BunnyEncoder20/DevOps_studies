## What is DevOps ?

- There were 2 teams before :
    - Developers: Devs who make the code for the apps
    - Operations: Ops who ensured that the apps were deployed and running stable
- But there was a lot of friction between the 2 teams (kinda like devs and testers right now)
- A DevOps Engineer is not supposed ot replace all the roles (Dev, Ops, Sec, QA) involved in DevOps but:
    - Bridging the gap between teams
    - Automating the boring or manual work so teams can move faster
    - Setting up tools and practices for smoother colaborations.
- So there was a thining and culture shift towards Dev-Ops so that both teams could work together in a coherent manner.
